# AGENTS.md — Working Effectively In This Repo

## Project Overview
- `update-downloads` is a Go CLI (`udl`) that orchestrates music sync workflows from source URLs into local libraries with deterministic, source-by-source execution.
- Core runtime stays in Go (config loading/validation, preflight planning, retries, logging, and UX), while v1 download engines remain external adapters (`scdl`, `spotdl`).
- Primary workflows are `init`, `validate`, `doctor`, and `sync`, with YAML config + state/archive files used to track known tracks, detect gaps, and control break/scan behavior.


## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages follow the existing short, imperative style; optional scoped prefixes (`menu:`, `settings:`, `tests:`, `fix:`). Keep them concise; present tense; no trailing period.


## Security & Configuration Tips
- Keep GitHub App secrets/private key out of the repo; tokens live in Keychain. 

If you encounter a violation in the repo or in a proposed change, explicitly call it out and propose a safer alternative.
Do not quietly change security-sensitive behavior. Call it out.


## A Note To The Agent

We are building this together. When you learn something non-obvious, add it here so future changes go faster.
